        <p class="information">These three animals in the picture are the pets of the Jimenez Family. From left to right there is Bagel the beagle, Lola the bunny, and Brownie the pitbull. My family was against the idea of owning pets up until we got our first pet. In 2017 my brother adopted our first pet and ever since then my family has been open to getting more pets.</p>
